# openllm-messaging

This project aims to integrate LLMs such as GPT-4o into people's lives more easily by providing access to them
via different popular messaging apps such as Telegram, Discord, possibly the Meta messaging suite
(Messenger, Instagram) and possibly open source platforms such as RocketChat or Matrix.
